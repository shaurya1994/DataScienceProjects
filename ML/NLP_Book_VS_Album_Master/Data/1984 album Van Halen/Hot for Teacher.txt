[Instrumental Intro]

[Spoken]
"Oh wow, man, that's it"
"Wait a second, man
What do you think the teacher's gonna look like this year?"
"My butt, man!"
Oh, uh!
Oh yeah!

[Verse 1]
T-t-teacher, stop that screamin'
Teacher, don't you see?
Don't wanna be no uptown fool
Maybe I should go to Hell, but I'm doin' well
And teacher needs to see me after school

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

[Chorus]
Ow, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher


[Spoken]
"Hey, I heard you missed us, we're back!"
("I'm ready")
"I brought my pencil
Gimme something to write on, man!"
Yeah, go
Uh!
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I heard about your lessons, but lessons are so cold
I know about this school
Little girl from Cherry Lawn, how can you be so bold?
How did you know that golden rule?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think of all the education that I missed
But then my homework was never quite like this

[Chorus]
Whoa, got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
I've got it bad, so bad
I'm hot for teacher
Wha-oh


[Guitar Solo]

[Spoken]
"Oh man, I think the clock is slow, man"
("What are you doing this weekend?")
"I don't feel tardy"
"Class dismissed!"
Ooh yeah

[Chorus]
I've got it bad, got it bad, got it bad
I'm hot for teacher
Oh
Oh, a-yes I'm hot
Wow!

[Outro]
Oh my God!
Whoo!
