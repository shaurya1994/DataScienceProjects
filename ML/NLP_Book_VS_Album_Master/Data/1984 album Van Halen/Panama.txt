[Intro]
Ooh
Oh yeah
Uh-huh, ah!

[Verse 1]
Jump back, what's that sound?
Here she comes, full blast and top down
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Model citizen, zero discipline

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!

[Chorus]
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' like it, her shiny machine
Got the feel for the wheel, keep the moving parts clean
Hot shoe, burning down the avenue
Out an on-ramp coming through my bedroom


[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know she's coming home to me?
You'll lose her in the turn
I'll get her, ah!
Uh-oh

[Chorus]
Panama
Panama, ow
Panama, ah
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo!

[Guitar Solo]

[Spoken Interlude]
Ah
Yeah, we're running a little bit hot tonight
I can barely see the road from the heat coming off it, I say
I reach down between my legs and
Ease the seat back

[Bridge]
She's blinding, I'm flying
Right behind in rearview mirror now
Got the fearing, power steering
Pistons popping, ain't no stopping now


[Chorus]
Panama
Panama
Panama
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama
Panama, oh-oh-oh-oh
Panama
