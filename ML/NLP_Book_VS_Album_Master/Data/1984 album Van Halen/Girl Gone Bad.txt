[Verse 1]
Ah lazy eyes in the summer heat
Fresh from outta town
Now she's working on the street
Shakin' poor boys down

[Chorus]
Uh (girl) uh girl gone bad
(Girl) girl gone bad

[Verse 2]
Found that girl with a lonesome John
But she should've been with me
Guess that woman fallen in love
She don't work for free

[Chorus]
Girl gone bad yeah, ah, ah, ah
Girl gone bad
(Girl) girl gone bad

[Outro]
Girl (ow, yeah)
Girl (oh oh oh)
Girl (yeah, yeah)
Girl (say, say)
